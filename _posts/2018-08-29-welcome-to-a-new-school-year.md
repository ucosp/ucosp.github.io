Students are starting to move into residences on campus so it must be time for the fall term to start (even if our weather here in Toronto doesn't feel like fall.)

The code sprint will be in Toronto at the [Mozilla offices](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/toronto/) in Toronto.  We have 7 projects lined up.  A huge thanks to Mozilla since 4 of the projects come from Mozilla.  Thanks also to the Review Board team and mentors for the Umple and Formulize teams for their long standing work on this program.
