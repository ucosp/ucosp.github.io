Students are starting to move into residences on campus so it must be time for the fall term to start (even if our weather here in Toronto doesn't feel like fall.)

The code sprint will be in Toronto at the (Mozilla offices)[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/toronto/] in Toronto.  We have 6 projects lined up so far and are trying to recruit a couple more so stay tuned.
